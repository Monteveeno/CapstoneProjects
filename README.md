In this project we going to create a game .
The game will have 4 characters  hero,enemy 1,enemy2 and enemy3.
We also going to make a prize for the hero character to collect.
Than we going to create a screen for the game and give our characters and with and height so that they dont fit out of the screen
We want the to position our character the the beginning of the screen which on my left and the enemy characters on the end of the screen on my right
The enemy charaters should approach our hero character and our hero character is allowed to move up and down.
If the hero character comes in contact with the one the enemy character we want the player to know that he lostl.
if the hero character dodges all the the enemy character and collects the prize we want the player to know that he won.
