In this project we want to create tasks due date and was it done
we also want the program to read from the user.txt file
what we focusing on in this program is to login from the from the user.txt file
if admin is logged in admin can make register a new user, assign new tasks, view all tasks.
all the users are allowed to view thier tasks with view my tasks in the meny
there should also be an option to exit the task.
if admin is logged in the menu should show everything
if another user is logged in the program should show a smaller menu
if admin wants to add another user we want this to write to task.txt
