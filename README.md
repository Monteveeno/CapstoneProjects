In this project we want the user to choose between investment and bond
if the user chooses investment we want the user to give us the deposit amount, interest that is given,The number of years the user is planning to invest,Than the user should decide between simple and compound interest.
I have also added both calculations for simple and compund interest.
If the user decides to choose the option bond
I want the user to tell us the current value of the bond
The user should tell us what is the interest rate
The user should tell us how many years does he plan to pay
than we going to divide the interest rate by 100 to give the perecent
the final step is to tell the user how much will he/she be paying
