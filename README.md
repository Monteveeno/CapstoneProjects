We will be continuing from the last capstone project
here we going to define functions and to initialize different classes
We going to def a few options to register a user add task and etc
I will be modifying register user to also let the user know that the username is taken 
We will also modify all code to what the user needs
# I want the menu to show
# If the user name and passowrd does not match i want it to say it is incorrect
I want the user tp enter the username and password and it should match the txt file
I want to open the file in user text
